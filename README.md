CSE331 - Microprocessor Interfacing & Embedded System
## Project Title
*Implementing Encryption Table using Microcontroller*

### Objectives
* Implement the encryption table provided and produce results based on the table
* Derive necessary KMAPS for implementing the logical function based on the
encryption table.
* Create a logical circuit corresponding to the encryption table
* Using the simplified version of the Boolean expressions derived from KMAPS and
implementing through arduino coding.
* Use both C and Register Level programming to implement the logical expression for Arduino UNO
* Simulate the operation of the encryption table in Proteus.

### Prerequisites
- Softwares needed
  - Logisim = For generating Karnaugh Maps
  - Arduino IDE (any version) = for C level programming and Register Level Programming
  - Proteus Version 8

### Schematic Circuit 
To build the schematic circuit the following components were used:
* Arduino Uno Model = SIMULINO UNO
* Resistors = 8 resistors of two values. 330 ohm with LEDS and 10k ohm with SPDT switches
* SPDT Switches = 4 switches
* LEDS = 4 LEDS
